## üìñ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict 3-month-ahead drought severity (SPEI-6) for Northern California.
- **Method:** Leverages historical satellite-derived environmental indicators including:
  - **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)** ‚Äì vegetation health  
  - **LST (Land Surface Temperature)** ‚Äì surface heat stress  
  - **ET & PET (Evapotranspiration metrics)** ‚Äì soil moisture and water balance  
- **Approach:**  
  1. Preprocessed remote sensing data from **MODIS** and **GRIDMET** (2000‚Äì2023).  
  2. Developed and compared **three models**:
      - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for temporal forecasting
      - **ConvLSTM** for spatial-temporal learning  
      - **XGBoost baseline** for comparison  
  3. Evaluated models using **RMSE** and **MAE**.

**Key Result:**  
Both LSTM and ConvLSTM significantly outperformed the XGBoost baseline (RMSE ‚Üì from 0.800 ‚Üí 0.268).
